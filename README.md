# IOI Gaming

![IOI HomePage](https://elisv.com/ioi.png)

IOI (Pronounced Eye-O-Eye) is a fictional e-commerce platform that was built for gaming enthusiast to hunt for deals. As a shop owner you are able to managed everything from the admin area including adding products, view orders, and much more. The project was built using mern.

## Admin Area

### 1. Dashboard

Store owners have a dashboard where they can track their weekly orders, revenue, profit margin, and order average.

Create, update and delete products. Upload as many images per product as you want as well have the ability to select multiple categories per product.

Create unique pages that can be retrieved from the api. Retrievable data includes hero image, link to where the hero image is pointing to as well as page description.

## Client Area

### 1. Searching & Filtering

Website visitors have the ability to search for different products as well as filter based on different categories and price ranges.

### 2. Adding items to cart

When you find something that catches your eye, you can add that said item into the cart and increment/decrement how many quantities of the item you want to buy.

### 3. Checkout

An e-commerce platform wouldn't be complete without a secure way to process payments. That's why I chose to use Stripe as my middleman that will process the payments. All orders are viable from the admin area. Also, each order is identified by a unique order number, which I think is very useful and cool to have.

## Built With

For this project, I chose to work with the mern stack and material UI.

## Known bugs/Future updates

- The graph in the admin area needs to be updated to reflect each new week. For now, it seems to show all orders that are placed on any given weekday.
- Not a bug, but a feature that will be added is a way to switch orders as shipped.

## Installation & Usage
